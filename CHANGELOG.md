### Feature

* feat: handle list value for add_dict_to_node function ([`f4324bf`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/f4324bf3291e37bf18ccbc2d229630513baf779c))

* feat: Provide beaker log links

Client like tmt may need to fetch the logs and store log contents ([`aa25ff3`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/aa25ff362022d86520e4a3196636a043f352b990))

### Fix

* fix(beaker): supress 10_avc_check restraint plugin

It has happpened that this plugin sometimes ran after the dummy task, it reported fail
that there was some AVC (probabaly from other thing) which then failed the job and thus
mrack treated this as a provisioning failure.

This patch instructs restraint to not run this plugin and thus avoid this situation.

### Test

* test: speed-up tests by mocking gethostbyaddr

Tests that are using mrack outputs are slowed down by
socker.gethostbyaddr for adhoc IP addresses. This resolution mostly
fails and the test is slow (multiple seconds timeout for single IP).

With this, all python tests are executed within 1.5s.

### Feature

* feat(openstack): Append API version to auth_url in credentials

This will save a manual step for the users when setting up clouds.yaml file,
as auth_url field is usually generated without specifying the version.

Version specification is needed by asyncopenstackclient libray

Signed-off-by: David Pascual &lt;davherna@redhat.com&gt; ([`3a59761`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/3a597615b9e28e1304ca2af3d1914db549f9f04c))


## v1.16.0 (2023-10-09)

### Chore

* chore(ci): Fix release workflow build step checking out wrong commit

actions/checkout checks out the latest commit at the time of the workflow trigger,
hence any commit done during the workflow is not included.
Fixing this to checkout the actual latest (release) commit.

Signed-off-by: David Pascual &lt;davherna@redhat.com&gt; ([`e8e20f1`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/e8e20f119f988eedd851495c54ff5c04ae60cc52))

credentials authentication.
Signed-off-by: David Pascual &lt;davherna@redhat.com&gt; ([`97a7cd0`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/97a7cd0518682a90d0655853333294290fea76ac))

* chore(release): Add PyPI action &amp; extract copr step

Due to latest changes to python semantic release
PyPI release is no longer supported and the separate
action (https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish)
is recomended to use while releasing to PyPI.
For the trusted publishing we had to set up the PyPI
account owning mrack to trust neoave/mrack repository
which I did and set up the actions jobs to build
the python package and trigger a truster build.
As an addition i have extracted copr to separate job.

Some resources:
https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/
https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish
https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating_from_v7.html

we had to move from v7 to 8 to use PyPI and have
build steps separate as v7 does that inplace.

* chore(Packit): Add internalt tests per pull request

Add internal tests for pre-defined usecases from
internal repository with the specifications.
These tests are switched by using MRACK_TEST_CASE
environment variable with a test that needs to be

* chore(Packit): add missing build job(s) to Packit config

Packit will now additionally require for each test job requiring build
a build job definition to be present in the Packit configuration file. See details
in https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/1775. ([`44023eb`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/44023ebf54f5196b1cdafdd01ba85d6005d99e49))

### Fix

* fix: Do not reprovision all hosts when server error is detected

when 500 code is detected in the error state of the errored VM
mrack would aggressively remove all hosts which have been
already provisioned properly. Changing logic that
if only a certain percentage of errored hosts is reached.

## v1.15.0 (2023-04-18)

### Chore

* chore: Release version 1.15.0

Releasing mrack version 1.15.0 ([`5903fb9`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/5903fb92b8f97e2b5851bfaeb20b84b834175fb8))

* chore: fix docs dependencies in tox run

Running `make test` or `tox` failed on building docs as the tox
config did not use the docsi/requirements.txt and thus the required
dependency which was recently added was missing.

This path is changing the tox run to use the docs/requirements.txt
and thus is fixing the issue.

### Documentation

* docs: SSH options design

Adding a design for configuring ssh options for mrack&#39;s ssh connection
check and Ansible inventory output with main purpose to have the Ansible
inventory settings consumable by Ansible calls used in  pytest-ansible.

Signed-off-by: Petr Vobornik &lt;pvoborni@redhat.com&gt; ([`88458e1`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/88458e12754054def3136a7d919f9d8061fd4300))

### Feature

* feat(outputs): preset username and password for windows host in pytest-mh

This implements the same behavior is pytest-multihost output. ([`86393ab`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/86393abed8e90ca36e71894f60cedf20046bfdac))

* feat(outputs): merge nested dictionary instead of overriding it

pytest-mh configuration may contain nested dictionary, specifying
username or password in pytest_mh section will result in overriding
the host option, i.e.:

```
pytest_mh:
  ssh:
    username: tuser
    password: tuserpassword
```

will generate wrong configuration where ssh/host is not set.

This patch makes sure that the ssh key is merged instead of overwritten. ([`4c26b5f`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/4c26b5ff7934efc8895eb83b3b89fe01a4d64257))

* feat(utils): add merge_dict

To combined two nested dictionaries. ([`4dde2e5`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/4dde2e5fb54b352d53048c2e147f63c3cbc79932))

* feat: configurable ssh options

This implements configurable ssh options according to design:

https://mrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/designs/ssh_options.html

With the idea that those options will be used for SSH connections
check as well as added to generated Ansible inventory so that other
tools can use it.

### Fix

* fix: mrack not re-provisioning hosts which were destroyed

Since I have coded a regression when trying to re-provision
mrack is not setting variables for another loop correctly
error_hosts is updated correctly but when keeping success_hosts
not changed to empty list it creates a illusion of hosts
which were deleted because of re-provisioning strategy
that they are still up and running.

``` ([`d3da251`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/d3da25156f91313ea5020bace15f20b7b0b5ce3f))

* feat(outputs): allow to choose which outputs should be generated

Add &#34;outputs&#34; key to the metadata file. E.g.:

```
outputs:
- ansible-inventory
- pytest-multihost
- pytest-mh

   ...
phases:
   ...
```

Defaults to ansible-inventory and pytest-multihost. ([`d3ac20d`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/d3ac20d4d3615893f4781c0142f47eb576db30e2))

* feat(outputs): add support for pytest-mh

Add support for generating pytest-mh configuration file, which is
similar to pytest-multihost but can make things more clear with
custom generator.

Add additional options:
- pytest-mh to mrack.conf, default path to the config file
- pytest_mh to host metadata, add additional values to the host config ([`66f2877`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/66f2877f0b3b33ced341fd6faf307d42414a4742))

If the group was empty, it returns empty dictionary and the condication
fails resulting in creating a new group instead of adding the host to
an existing one. ([`0735e36`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/0735e36c16aec74c7920f755bf7367d8ba59c790))

Missing ci.fmf sync causes fedora message being not recognized
in dowsntream and thus expected tests to be marked as failed
even when tests might be run and passing.

### Feature

* feat(OpenStack): Provide a way to disable network spreading

The network spreading feature has aimed to utilize networks usage
however for some particular products it might be not optimal
to have resources on different networks. This patch is adding
options to mrack.conf which can disable the feature and also
set the acceptable threshold of network utilization for OpenStack.

network-spread = no  # disable the feature
network-spread = force  # force the feature
network-spread = allow  # allow the feature (default)
max-network-utilization = 75 (default=50)

When the request size exceeds max network utilization mrack
falls back to default behavior of spreading the requests to
different networks (Corner case of having too few IPs).

mrack fails if the feature is disabled and request is too big.

* feat: Do not use same sleep for every mrack run

Adding logic to randomize the timeout to basically
set the waiting timeout to vary from 45-75 minutes randomly
and the poll time to 45-75 seconds accordingly
so if there are multiple parallel runs of mrack they wait
different amount time before poll and increase chance to get resources
quicker than other concurrent runs of mrack requests

Add cooldown after error host was found to wait before
another retry and resource check cycle for random time
between one poll sleep and 2* poll sleep (45-75 s is one poll)

Add utilization method template to decide whether to
destroy all machines or to keep them while re-provisioning
to free some resources when there is provided highly utilized.

### Fix

* fix(OpenStack): fix condition for network to get in interval

In corner case with 2 ip adresses left and requesting
2 ip adresses from mrack there was an issue that mrack
has picked same network for both request which eventually
break the request. Fixing the condition that when counting
weights the mrack will divide two ips like it should.

builtin funtion string which is not empty returns True

* chore: Add packit service configuration

This commit is enabling packit service for the mrack
project. see: https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/

To start using Packit we did:
- set up integration on GitHub side and selected free plan
- got approved by mapping FAS identity (tdudlak) to the
  service via: https://github.com/packit/notifications/issues/482
  by linking neoave organization with FAS account
- configured the wanted features via this commit

This commit sets up packit jobs to:
- check build per pull request
- trigger copr build after a release
- create fedora PRs to mrack project with updates
- create koji build per commit merged to fedora&#39;s mrack
- create bodhi updates per each successful koji build

This allows us to forget about backporting pathces
to Fedora repo and automate release workflow per
each supported Fedora release currently not EOL.

### Fix

* fix: make db file and provisioning file optional

When initializing the global context these files
should be passed to the init as optional param
when path is specified in mrack cli tool.

the mrack.conf file records and rely on paths
set there for db and provisioning-config.

Limitin only for certain providers is needed as the owner doesn&#39;t matter for
static (vm already present somewhere, could be owned by completely different

### Feature

* feat(AWS): Add multiple subnet support &amp; IPs availability check

- Now mrack expects either subnets_id (prioritized) or subnet_id field in the provisioning config file or metadata (provder config) in AWS key field.
  A list of subnets can be specified where host can be provisioned. It is expected that the subnets are in the same VPC.
- mrack checks that the amount IPs available with all the subnets specified are enough to provision all the host concurrently.
  The amount of IPs available for provisioning are the sum of the available IPs in the provided subnets.
  Otherwise provisioning will retried after a wait and/or cancelled.
- Add rule to pylintrc file to allow more local variables in methods.

### Feature

* feat(OpenStack): Pick from all networks based on load

With this patch OpenStack is able to pick Network from
all of networks based on network load and requirement
got from the metadata. Each of required host gets
its own position, aka weigh in interval &lt;0, 1&gt;
based on the order (index) in metadata. Before that
all of the networks are &#39;normalized&#39; in a way that
the random selection from subset of networks
(or all of network if number of hosts &gt; number of networks)
is divided to effective range (multiple intervals &lt;0, 1&gt;)
for the network based on the relative network weight
compared to full capacity of considered networks.

An example:
- considering 5 host request
- picked 5 networks where availability is &gt; 5%

Host weights:
- host 1 - 0/5 = 0
- host 2 - 1/5 = 0.2
- host 3 - 2/5 = 0.4
- host 4 - 3/5 = 0.6
- host 5 - 4/5 = 0.8

Network availability:
- net 1 - 20 addresses
- net 2 - 100 addresses
- net 3 - 130 addresses
- net 4 - 145 addresses
- net 5 - 105 addresses

Full capacity of these 5 nets: 500

Normalized network range:
net 4 - &lt;0, 0.29&gt;
net 3 - (0,29, 0.55&gt;
net 5 - (0.55, 0.76&gt;
net 2 - (0.76, 0.96&gt;
net 1 - (0.96, 1&gt;

Which will divide networks for hosts:
host 1 =&gt; net 4 (0 falls into net 4 interval)
host 2 =&gt; net 4 (0.2 falls into net 4 interval)
host 3 =&gt; net 3 (0.4 falls into net 3 interval)
host 4 =&gt; net 5 (0.6 falls into net 5 interval)
host 5 =&gt; net 2 (0.8 falls into net 2 interval)

### Feature

* feat: Split mrack spec to multiple packages

Splitting mrack to:
- mrack
- mrack-cli
- python3-mracklib
- python3-mrack-aws
- python3-mrack-beaker
- python3-mrack-openstack
- python3-mrack-podman
- python3-mrack-virt

where python3-mracklib contains only static provider and all the
scripts and provisioning base logic.
we can install mrack-{aws,beaker,openstack,podman,virt}
providers in addition to static provider extending
the functionality and create modular solution where only
needed providers can be installed.
Package mrack contains all supported providers.
Package mrack-cli contains mrack command.
We are using Suggests directives for OpenStack dependencies
so in fedora where these are not available build will pass.

## v1.6.0 (2022-07-27)

### Chore

* chore: Release version 1.6.0

Releasing mrack version 1.6.0 ([`9c0b89b`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/9c0b89b6f647ff38472b32cdacb6a05fc8a8eb8a))

### Feature

* feat(pytest-multihost): arbitrary attributes for hosts

Make it possible to add arbitrary attributes per-host via defining them
in pytest_multihost dictionary in host section of job metadata file.

* feat(ansible-inventory): host arbitrary attributes

Adding a possibility to add arbitrary attributes to host part of
generated Ansible inventory via defining them per-host in new dictonary
`ansible_inventory`.

This is useful for creating more complex jobs which are using ansible
playbooks or roles requiring to get vars from hosts.

* feat: copyign meta_ attributes from host to ansible inventory

Make it possible to define arbitratry attributes prefix with meta_
in host section of job metadata file.

All of these attributes are then copied to host part in ansible
inventory output.

It can serve for creation of playbooks which consumes these attributes.

Addtional, but probably rare use case, is to override the meta_ attrs
which are derived from other others by mrack.

### Fix

* fix(pytest-multihost): crash when group is not defined

It should possible to define host groups either via &#34;group&#34; or &#34;groups&#34;
variable. But pytest-multihost output was crashing when it was done via
&#34;groups&#34;.

This fix makes it not to crash if both are missing. It also makes it
possible to use first group from &#34;groups&#34; if groups are defined -
similar as in Ansible inventory output.

### Fix

* fix: Creating inventory with None host

The code in create_invetory method was looping hostnames from the DB,
which some of them may have already been deleted, which cause a None return
when trying to get their metadata.

without previously deleting mrackdb.json

### Feature

* feat(Beaker): Support distro variant configuration

Before this patch the distro variant could not be configured
and was hardcoded in the source code of the mrack project.

In order to know what image is the latest tag pointing to in Openstack,
meta_compose_id and meta_compose_url fields from image meta information are

* feat: possibility to disable host DNS resolution in outputs

Ansible inventory&#39;s `ansible_host` or pytest-multihost&#39;s
`external_hostname` currently by default tries to resolve host&#39;s IP
address and use the DNS name if resolution is successfull.

This change allows to disable this behavior by setting:
  resolve_host: False
Somewhere in the configuration hierarchy (metatadat host, provider
config, or global provisioning config).

* feat(aws): request spot instances

Spot instances are a great way how to save money for CI purposes.

https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot

This is inital implementation where the only possible option is to
ask for spot instance, but not define SpotOptions - this can be
extended later if wanted.

How to use:
- set `spot: True` in `aws` provider to enable it globally
- set `spot: True` in host section in job metadata file to request
  a spot instance for this particular host.

Additional changes:
- removes stopping instance on destroy as it doesn&#39;t work with
  default behaviour of spot instances + correctly handle exception when
  stopping fails (previous behaviour crashed mrack)
- prepares a parameters dict to be able to control what is passed to
  ec2.create_instances, + partly fixes a possible regression with
  SubNetId

* feat(aws): defining AMIs by tags

Add a new way to define an AWS EC2 image in a provisiong config in
addition to ami ID.

The following is valid:

```
images:
  fedora-34: ami-0d3c5199abb29a7ae
  fedora-35: { tag: { name: compose, value: mrack-fedora-35-latest } }
```

This allows for a seperate tool to upload new image with the same
purpose and mrack automatically picks the latest one with the given
tag.

Currently only one tag is supported and it search in all images.

Possible improvements:
- more tags
- limiting to private images

* feat(Beaker): Add parsing of HostRequires to the job

mrack now supports the hostRequires in the host metadata
or default in provisioning config yaml.

NOTE: CASE MATTERS

The hostRequires for the host should look like following:
hostRequires:
  or:
    - hostname:
        _value: foo1.bar.baz.com
        _op: &#34;=&#34;
    - hostname:
        _value: foo2.bar.baz.com
        _op: &#34;=&#34;
  and:
    - system:
        memory:
          _value: 8000
          _op: &#34;&gt;&#34;
    - arch:
        _value: x86_64
        _op: &#34;=&#34;
    - system_type:
        _value: Machine
        _op: &#34;=&#34;
    - key_value:
        _key: HVM
        _value: 1
        _op: &#34;=&#34;
    - disk:
        size:
          _value: 137438953472
          _op: &#34;&gt;&#34;

Which will result into following xml for the job specification:

&lt;hostRequires&gt;
  &lt;or&gt;
    &lt;hostname value=&#34;foo1.bos.redhat.com&#34; op=&#34;=&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;hostname value=&#34;foo2.bos.redhat.com&#34; op=&#34;=&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;/or&gt;
  &lt;and&gt;
    &lt;system&gt;
      &lt;memory value=&#34;8000&#34; op=&#34;&amp;gt;&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/system&gt;
    &lt;arch value=&#34;x86_64&#34; op=&#34;=&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;system_type value=&#34;Machine&#34; op=&#34;=&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;key_value key=&#34;HVM&#34; value=&#34;1&#34; op=&#34;=&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;disk&gt;
      &lt;size value=&#34;137438953472&#34; op=&#34;&amp;gt;&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/disk&gt;
  &lt;/and&gt;
&lt;/hostRequires&gt;
and such requirement will be uploaded to the beaker hub
and schedule a job with this requirements.

* feat(Podman): Add possibility to run post provisioning commands

Now there is a possibility to specify extra post provisioning
commands with using &#39;extra_commands&#39; section in podman config.
podman:
    extra_commands:
        - &#34;systemctl restart sshd&#34;

### Fix

* fix(OpenStack): Do not raise exception when using unavailable network

In some cases when network has an outage or is temporarily
removed etc. mrack would raise an exception when getting
the &#34;id&#34; from network which is set to &#39;None&#39; which is
obvious AttributeError: &#39;NoneType&#39; object has no attribute &#39;get&#39;

* fix(openstack): use shortnames for Windows vm names

Windows machines get hostname often by Cloudbase-Init. But
windows host support setting only shortnames (domain is added
when the host joins AD domain). OpenStack derives the hostnane
from vm name (until nova version 2.90 where hostname attr is added).
Thus we set shortname to support this also on older OpenStacks.

mrack now uses the GlobalContext object to store
the information for every particular run.
This object is defined in the context.py
And should be initialized for the run.

- Openstack succeeds
then
- Beaker cancel jobs

in the metadata file. If the metadata does not
contain the size key for host entry flavor

### Feature

* feat: gracefully destroy servers after traceback

This allows us to create dummy Host object based
on the ProvisioningError traceback arguments
where we added also requirement which may have
caused the provisioning to fail so the worflow
can continue and remove already provisioned
servers after reprovision / abort strategy is
done so resources that may not be freed
to openstack will be returned.

* feat: Wait for provider resources up to hour

Checking resources more than once should help
to provide better results when we are facing
the providers to be overocupied.

* feat(OpenStack): Check openstack response for resources issue

OpenStack may be oversubscribed so even when we do not reach
our quota limit provisioning may fail due to lack of resources.
In such scenario (OpenStack run out of hosts to provision)
we check the response from server and act based on the fact
that OpenStack itself is being fully loaded and does not have
free resources to provide for our server.

* feat(Virt): use generated run IDs for parallel jobs

It may be common use case to run on one host machine two mrack jobs
with job metadata files which share hostnames. This may result in
conflict in testcloud as it identifies the vms by provided name. So
this patch is generating a pseudo unique run ID which is used as a
prefix for testcloud vm names and thus making it whole unique and
conflict resilient.

* feat: password authentication in ssh_to_host

ssh_to_host had some code for password authentication but it never
worked so this is basically a new feature.

Password authentication is preferred over sshkey as sshkey is often
defined globally and preffering it would e.g. not work for virt
provider. It is assuming that if a host has a password set then
it should work.

* feat: Virt a local virtual machine provider

PoC implementation which uses testcloud library to do most of the
heavy lifting. The idea is to use cloud images for local provisioning.

First implementation doesn&#39;t do much about image sources and expects
urls of images to be in provisioning config. Later this should be
improved to allow dynamic loading of latest images from the sources
without a need to change them often manually.

* feat(OpenStack): move network translation to provider

Moving network translation to provider will help us
to find new network for openstack VM when there
is a problem with network pools (insufficient ips)
that will help to choose another pool within openstack.

Transformer now only informs about network type
provider picks the network at every provision retry.
Touches little bit commit:

* feat(OpenStack): distribute choosing of networks

Currenlty Mrack always chooses a network with the most available IPs.

This is good for a lot of use cases but is problematic when a lot of
jobs are started at the same time. Each of the jobs is doing a
separate network availability check. This can lead to a situation
where almost all jobs pick the same and start provisioning with it.

But this network might not have enough IPs for everything so there
is a increased chance that it will fail. E.g if there is 300 available
IPs and we run 100 jobs which needs 3-4 machines.

Indroducing a new behavior where Mrack is picking a random network from
networks which have at least 50% of IPs as the bests one. Thus spreading
the load and lowering the chance of the issue to happening.

It will not solve the issue completely. This can be improved e.g.
in re-provision logic.

* feat: OpenStack: increase polling time based on number of hosts

Increase polling times so that Mrack doesn&#39;t poll very often to
not overload the server when a lot of hosts is provisioned.

Current setting should be approx:

hosts   init_wait   poll_time   After 10mins    After 15mins
    1       15.65        7.22          48.77           69.55
    3       16.95        7.66          46.82           66.41
    7       19.55        8.54          43.67           61.23
   10       21.50        9.20          41.81           58.11
   30       34.50       13.60          35.66           46.69
  100       80.00       29.00          39.34           44.52
  200      145.00       51.00          56.88           59.82

Where &#34;After 10/15mins&#34; is poll_time after the time, but it is not
a precise value (did not want to spend time on calculating it).

it broke assumtion that Windows host have it set. So this is a fix

## v0.5.0 (2020-12-11)

### Feature

* feat: Retry provisioning strategy

Optional (currently aplied only for OpenStack) provisioning strategy
to retry provisioning of host which ended with error in a provisioning
attempt.

This is useful if environment gets into state where the provisioning
is a bit unstable but in general working. I.e. succeeds for some host
and fails for others.

The Retry strategy:
1. tries to provision all hosts
2. if some failed, delete them and retry only for these hosts
3. if they fail more than max_attempts time(default: 5), fail the job

Default strategy:
- do 1.
- if some failed, fail the job

In each job failure case:
- delete all hosts

### Feature

* feat: Output file paths configurable in mrack config

Adding a possibility to change Ansible inventory and pytest multihost
configuration output file paths in a mrack config file. So that a user
can use directly a custom location.

Example of such config:

```ini
[mrack]
mrackdb = config/mrackdb.json
provisioning-config = config/provisioning-config.yaml
metadata = config/metadata.yaml
ansible-inventory = config/test.inventory.yaml
pytest-multihost = config/pytest-multihost-config.yaml
```

* feat: Simple way to add hosts into /etc/hosts file

This is useful for cases where the fake hostname needs to be used
e.g. when accessing FreeIPA Web UI which is sensitive on used hostname.

It is uncomfortable task to read the values from `mrack list` and add
them manualy to /etc/hosts.

The change introduces two commands to help with this case:

* `$ mrack eh add` to add all active hosts into /etc/hosts
* `$ mrack eh clear` to remove all records added by mrack.

Mrack adds two markers into the /etc/hosts file and adds records
between them. This should work also with multiple runs of mrack in
separate tests. If the section already contains the fake hostname then
this line is overwritten with a new value. This is useful when
provisioning hosts for the same task after they were previously
removed.

metadata = config/metadata.yaml
```

Where each value is optional and existance of the config is also
optional.

Mrack looks for the config on these locations:
- user provided path via -c or --mrack-config global option
- ./mrack.conf
- ~/.mrack/mrack.conf
- /etc/mrack/mrack.conf

It also changes CLI of commands:
- metadata is no longer an argument but an option: -m or --metadata
- provisioning config shortcut changes to global -p

With these changes it is possible to define a config file to allow
just typing:
```
$ mrack up
$ mrack list
$ mrack ssh
$ mrack output
$ mrack destroy
```

The MrackConfig class is also extensible for new use cases.

* Add mrack.conf from which we load defaults

Add mrack.conf which contains default enfironment
configuration in ini format for the click options
- `--config=provisioning-config from mrack.conf`
- `--db=mrackdb from mrack.conf`

Load default for options from the mrack.conf file from:
1. use `$(pwd)/mrack.conf` or other way the `./mrack.conf` - actual directory
2. or use user home directory configuration - `~/.mrack/mrack.conf`
3. alternatively directory `/etc/mrack/mrack.conf` as safe fallback.

Add example `mrack.conf` and `provisioning-config.yaml`
to the `data/` directory in repository.

Update setup.py to install required files from `data/` dir. ([`951c08f`](https://github.com/neoave/mrack/commit/951c08fb9e80c3dc099751e08f6ed16594c7362d))

* Do not set username for pytest multihost config

We have actually not used it at it cannot be assumed that
the user used for provisioning should be used for pytest-multihost.

E.g. a lot of tests rely on root - to be able to completely control
the remote machine. That cannot be done, e.g. with default cloud-user.

(Though it can often sudo to root)

Let&#39;s keep there the more simple configuration, where user is the
same for all host and is defined in provisioning config &#39;mhcfg&#39; dir.

* Fix OpenStack provisioning status translation

It is not needed to use a STATUS_MAP for translation status in
prov_result_to_host_data as it is done also in to_host of parent
class. Double translation doesn&#39;t work and thus everything provisioned
had incorrecly status : &#34;other&#34;.

This has then a negative effect on ssh actione where no host is reported
as active.

* Do not show traceback on ApplicationError

So that, e.g., on ssh action, when there are no active host, user
will not get an exception ending with:

```
raise ApplicationError(&#34;No active host available.&#34;)
```

But only:
```
No active host available.
```

Which is more user friendly.

### Documentation

* docs: set master doc to index

From sphinx doc:
&#34;&#34;&#34;
master_doc

    The document name of the “master” document, that is, the document
    that contains the root toctree directive. Default is &#39;index&#39;.

    Changed in version 2.0: The default is changed to &#39;index&#39; from &#39;contents&#39;.
&#34;&#34;&#34;

Read the docs is using version &lt; 2.0 thus it tries to find &#39;content&#39;s
and it fails.

Also changing theme to default - no real reason, thinking it will be
better.

* ansible-inventory: rework generation of groups

The Ansible inventory output was not correctly adding hosts into groups. E.g.
group was not added when it was not defined in layout. Nested group was not
correctly found and host added.

This part is completely reworked and changes the behavior to:
- add only a host name reference (no vars) into custom groups
- add missing groups as children of &#39;all&#39; group
- works with both &#34;groups&#34; and &#34;group&#34; defined in metadata
- add all hosts to &#39;all&#39; with also variables. This ensures that the full host
  object is defined only once.

Static provider serves for mixing already provisioned hosts (pets)
with dynamically provisioned hosts. Alternatively all hosts can
be static. This can be useful for generating the outputs and using
other features.

be deleted by static provider. The most important parts is to provide

* make up and destroy action work

Finishing of previous &#34;WIP&#34; architecture commit. With this, provisioning
in OpenStack is working. I.e. machines can be provisioned by up action
and destroyed by destroy action with state saved using File driver.

* WIP: Main app architecture with basic functionality

Adding:
- up action
- destroy action

Introducing concepts:

Trasnsformers: combines metadata together with provisioning config to
get configuration for providers.

Outputs: transform result of providers to various files like ansible
inventory or pytest-multihost config

Drivers: saves results of actions to file so that it can be used
later. E.g. up action result to be used for destroy action.

Adds basic CLI entry point for debugging or standalone usage.
